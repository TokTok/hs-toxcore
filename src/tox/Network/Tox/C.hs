-- | Public core API for Tox clients.
--
-- Every function that can fail takes a function-specific error code pointer
-- that can be used to diagnose problems with the Tox state or the function
-- arguments. The error code pointer can be NULL, which does not influence the
-- function's behaviour, but can be done if the reason for failure is irrelevant
-- to the client.
--
-- The exception to this rule are simple allocation functions whose only failure
-- mode is allocation failure. They return NULL in that case, and do not set an
-- error code.
--
-- Every error code type has an OK value to which functions will set their error
-- code value on success. Clients can keep their error code uninitialised before
-- passing it to a function. The library guarantees that after returning, the
-- value pointed to by the error code pointer has been initialised.
--
-- Functions with pointer parameters often have a NULL error code, meaning they
-- could not perform any operation, because one of the required parameters was
-- NULL. Some functions operate correctly or are defined as effectless on NULL.
--
-- Some functions additionally return a value outside their
-- return type domain, or a bool containing true on success and false on
-- failure.
--
-- All functions that take a Tox instance pointer will cause undefined behaviour
-- when passed a NULL Tox pointer.
--
-- All integer values are expected in host byte order.
--
-- Functions with parameters with enum types cause unspecified behaviour if the
-- enumeration value is outside the valid range of the type. If possible, the
-- function will try to use a sane default, but there will be no error code,
-- and one possible action for the function to take is to have no effect.
--
-- \subsection events Events and callbacks
--
-- Events are handled by callbacks. One callback can be registered per event.
-- All events have a callback function type named `tox_{event}_cb` and a
-- function to register it named `tox_callback_{event}`. Passing a NULL
-- callback will result in no callback being registered for that event. Only
-- one callback per event can be registered, so if a client needs multiple
-- event listeners, it needs to implement the dispatch functionality itself.
--
-- \subsection threading Threading implications
--
-- It is possible to run multiple concurrent threads with a Tox instance for
-- each thread. It is also possible to run all Tox instances in the same thread.
-- A common way to run Tox (multiple or single instance) is to have one thread
-- running a simple tox_iterate loop, sleeping for tox_iteration_interval
-- milliseconds on each iteration.
--
-- If you want to access a single Tox instance from multiple threads, access
-- to the instance must be synchronised. While multiple threads can concurrently
-- access multiple different Tox instances, no more than one API function can
-- operate on a single instance at any given time.
--
-- Functions that write to variable length byte arrays will always have a size
-- function associated with them. The result of this size function is only valid
-- until another mutating function (one that takes a pointer to non-const Tox)
-- is called. Thus, clients must ensure that no other thread calls a mutating
-- function between the call to the size function and the call to the retrieval
-- function.
--
-- E.g. to get the current nickname, one would write
--
-- \code
-- size_t length = tox_self_get_name_size(tox);
-- uint8_t *name = malloc(length);
-- if (!name) abort();
-- tox_self_get_name(tox, name);
-- \endcode
--
-- If any other thread calls tox_self_set_name while this thread is allocating
-- memory, the length may have become invalid, and the call to
-- tox_self_get_name may cause undefined behaviour.
