\chapter{DHT Group Chats Packet Protocols}

All packet fields are considered mandatory unless flagged as \textbf{\verb'[optional]'}.
The minimum size of an encrypted packet is 83 bytes for lossless and 75
bytes for lossy. The maximum size of an encrypted packet is 1400 bytes.

\section{Full Packet Structure}

\subsection{Plaintext header}

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Length             & Contents \\
  \hline
  \texttt{1}         & Packet Kind \\
  \texttt{32}        & Sender's Public Encryption Key \\
  \texttt{32}        & Receiver's Public Encryption Key \textbf{\verb'[optional]'} \\
  \texttt{24}        & Nonce \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Encrypted header}

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Length             & Contents \\
  \hline
  \texttt{0-8}       & Padding \\
  \texttt{1}         & Group Packet Identifier \\
  \texttt{8}         & Message Id \textbf{\verb'[optional]'} \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Encrypted payload}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Length             & Contents \\
  \hline
  Variable           & Payload \\
\end{tabular}

The plaintext header contains a \textbf{\verb'Toxcore Network Packet Kind'}
which identifies the toxcore networking level packet type. These types
are:
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Type                                    & Net Packet ID \\
  \hline
  \textbf{\verb'NET_PACKET_GC_HANDSHAKE'} & 0x5a \\
  \textbf{\verb'NET_PACKET_GC_LOSSLESS'}  & 0x5b \\
  \textbf{\verb'NET_PACKET_GC_LOSSY'}     & 0x5c \\
\end{tabular}

The sender's public encryption key is used to identify the peer who sent
the packet, as well as to identify the group instance for which the packet
is intended for all \textbf{\verb'NET_PACKET_GC_LOSSLESS'}
and \textbf{\verb'NET_PACKET_GC_LOSSY'} packets. It is also used to establish
a secure connection with the sender during the handshake protocol.

The receiver's public encryption key is only sent in
\textbf{\verb'NET_PACKET_GC_HANDSHAKE'} packets, and is used to identify
the group instance for which the packet is intended.

The encrypted header for lossless and lossy packets contains between 0
and 8 bytes of empty padding. The \textbf{\verb'Group Packet Identifier'}
is used to identify the type of group packet, and the
\textbf{\verb'Message ID'} is a unique packet identifier which is used
for the lossless UDP implementation.

The encrypted payload contains arbitrary data specific to the respective
group packet identifier. The length may range from zero to the maximum
packet size (minus the headers). These payloads will be the focus of the
remainder of this document.

\section{Handshake packet payloads}

Handshake packet payloads are structured as follows:

\subsection{HANDSHAKE\_REQUEST (0x00) and HANDSHAKE\_RESPONSE (0x01)}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Length                & Contents \\
  \hline
  \texttt{32}           & Public Session Key \\
  \texttt{32}           & Public Signature Key \\
  \texttt{1}            & Request Type \\
  \texttt{1}            & Join Type \\
  variable              & 1 Packed TCP Relay \\
\end{tabular}
\hline
This packet type is used to initiate a secure connection with a peer.

The \textbf{\verb'Public Session Key'} is a temporary key unique to this peer
which, along with its secret counterpart, will be used to create a
shared session encryption key. This keypair is used for all further
communication for the current session. It must only be used for a single
peer, and must be discarded of once the connection with the peer is
severed.

The \textbf{\verb'Public Signature Key'} is our own permanent signature key
for this group chat.

The \textbf{\verb'Request Type'} is an identifier for the type of handshake
being initiated, defined as an enumerator starting at zero as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Type                                          & ID \\
  \hline
  \textbf{\verb'HANDSHAKE_INVITE_REQUEST'}      & 0x00 \\
  \textbf{\verb'HANDSHAKE_PEER_INFO_EXCHANGE'}  & 0x01 \\
\end{tabular}

If the request type is an invite request, the receiving peer must
respond with a \textbf{\verb'INVITE_REQUEST'} packet. If the request type is a
peer info exchange, the receiving peer must respond with a
\textbf{\verb'PEER_INFO_RESPONSE'} packet followed immediately by a
\textbf{\verb'PEER_INFO_REQUEST'} packet.

The \textbf{\verb'Join_Type'} indicates whether the initiator of a handshake
is joining via the public DHT or a private friend invite, and is defined
as an enumerator beginning at zero as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Type                     & ID \\
  \hline
  \textbf{\verb'PUBLIC'}   & 0x00 \\
  \textbf{\verb'PRIVATE'}  & 0x01 \\
\end{tabular}

The packed TCP relay contains a TCP relay that the sender may be
connected through by the receiver.

\section{Lossy Packet Payloads}

\subsection{PING (0x01)}
A ping packet payload is structured as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Length                & Contents \\
  \hline
  \texttt{2}            & Peerlist Checksum \\
  \texttt{2}            & Confirmed Peer Count \\
  \texttt{4}            & Shared State Version \\
  \texttt{4}            & Sanctions Credentials Version \\
  \texttt{2}            & Sanctions Credentials Checksum \\
  \texttt{4}            & Topic Version \\
  \texttt{2}            & Topic Checksum \\
  Variable              & Packed IP Address and Port \\
\end{tabular}

Ping packets are periodically sent to every confirmed peer in order to
maintain peer connections, and to ensure the group state between peers
are in sync. A peer is considered to be disconnected from the group after
a ping packet has not been receieved over a period of time.

\subsection{MESSAGE\_ACK (0x02)}

Message ack packets are structured as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Length                & Contents \\
  \hline
  \texttt{8}            & Message ID \\
  \texttt{1}            & Type \\
\end{tabular}

This packet ensures that all lossless packets are successfully
received and processed in sequential order as they were sent.

Message ack types are defined by an enumerator beginning at zero as
follows:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Type                          & ID \\
  \hline
  \textbf{\verb'GR_ACK_RECV'}   & 0x00 \\
  \textbf{\verb'GR_ACK_REQ'}    & 0x01 \\
\end{tabular}

If the type is \textbf{\verb'GR_ACK_RECV'}, this indicates that the packet
with the given id has been received and successfully processed. If the
type is \textbf{\verb'GR_ACK_REQ'}, this indicates that the message with the
given id should be sent again.

\subsection{INVITE\_RESPONSE\_REJECT (0x03)}

An invite response reject payload is structured as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Length                & Contents \\
  \hline
  \texttt{1}            & Type \\
\end{tabular}

This packet alerts a peer that their invite request has been rejected. The
reason for the rejection is specified by the \textbf{\verb'type'} field.

Rejection types are defined by an enumerator beginning at zero as
follows:
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Type                              & ID \\
  \hline
  \textbf{\verb'GROUP_FULL'}        & 0x00 \\
  \textbf{\verb'INVALID_PASSWORD'}  & 0x01 \\
  \textbf{\verb'INVITE_FAILED'}     & 0x02 \\
\end{tabular}

\section{Lossless Packet Payloads}

\subsection{KEY\_ROTATIONS (0xf0)}

Key rotation packets are structured as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Length                & Contents \\
  \hline
  \texttt{1}            & \textbf{\verb'is_response'} \\
  \texttt{32}           & Public Encryption Key \\
\end{tabular}

Key rotation packets are used to rotate session encryption keys with
a peer. If \textbf{\verb'is_response'} is false, the packet initiates a
public key exchange. Otherwise the packet is a response to a previously
initiated exchange.

The public encryption key must be a newly generated key which takes
the place of the previously used session key. The resulting shared
session key is generated using the same protocol as the initial
handshake, and must be kept secret.

Request packets should only be sent by the peer whose permanent public
encryption key for the given group is closer to the group
\textbf{\verb'Chat ID'} according to the \href{#distance}{\texttt{Distance}}
metric.

\subsection{TCP\_RELAYS (0xf1)}

A TCP relay packet payload is structured as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Length                & Contents \\
  \hline
  Variable              & Packed TCP Relays \\
\end{tabular}

The purpose of this packet is to share a list of TCP relays with a
confirmed peer. Used to maintain a list of mutual TCP relays with
other peers, which are used to maintain TCP connections when direct
connections cannot be established.

This packet is sent to every confirmed peer whenever a new TCP relay is
added to our list, or periodically when we presently have no shared TCP
relays with a given peer.

\subsection{CUSTOM\_PACKETS (0xf2)}

A custom packet payload is structured as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  Length                & Contents \\
  \hline
  Variable              & Arbitrary Data \\
\end{tabular}

This packet is used to to send arbitrary data to another peer. It may be
used for client-side features.

\subsection{BROADCAST (0xf3)}

  Length                 & Contents \\
  \hline
  \texttt{1}             & Type \\
  Variable               & Payload \\
\end{tabular}

This packet broadcasts a message to all confirmed peers in a group (with the
exception of \textbf{\verb'PRIVATE_MESSAGE'}). The type of broadcast is
specificed by the \textbf{\verb'type'} field.

\subsection{INVITE\_RESPONSE (0xf7)}

An invite response packet has an empty payload.

This packet alerts a peer who sent us an \textbf{\verb'INVITE_REQUEST'} packet
that their request has been validated, which informs them that they may
continue to the next step in the handshake protocol.

Before sending this packet we first attempt to validate the invite
request. If validation fails, we instead send a packet of type
\textbf{\verb'INVITE_RESPONSE_REJECT'} in response, and remove the peer from
our peer list.

announce, which is a data structure that contains all of the information
about a peer needed to initiate the handshake protocol via TCP relays, a
direct connection, or both.

If the \textbf{\verb'IP_Port_Is_Set'} flag is non-zero, the packet will
contain a packed \textbf{\verb'IP_Port'} of the peer associated with
the given public key. If \textbf{\verb'TCP Relays Count'} is greater than
0, the packet will contain a list of tcp relays that the peer associated
with the given public key is connected to.

When responding to a sync request, one separate sync response will be
sent for each peer in the peer list. All other requested group
information is sent via its respective packet.

\subsection{HS\_RESPONSE\_ACK (0xff)}

A handshake response ack packet has an empty payload. This
packet is used to send acknowledgement that a lower level toxcore
\textbf{\verb'NET_PACKET_GC_HANDSHAKE'} packet has been received, which is
the first step in the group handshake protocol. This packet will
initiate an invite request via the \textbf{\verb'INVITE_REQUEST'} packet.
